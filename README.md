# Suki POS
`Suki POS` is an open source Point of Sale available for your business. `Suki` is a Filipino word that means `regular customer`. Suki is locally made from the province of the Philippines :)

The POS itself is written using popular Flutter framework so that we can use it for multiple platform.

The POS client is availble for mobile (Android, iOS) and Desktop (Windows, Linux and OSX).
